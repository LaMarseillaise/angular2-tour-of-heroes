# angular2-tour-of-heroes

This app was created by following the [Angular 2 tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/). The goal of this tutorial was to create a navigatable list of heroes, using a fake web API, with the ability to add, update, and delete heroes.

I elected to follow the TypeScript version since it seems to be preferred by creators and I was interested in the language.
